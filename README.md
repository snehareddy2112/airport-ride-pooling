# 🚗 AIRPORT RIDE POOLING SYSTEM

A scalable backend system that groups passengers into shared airport cabs while respecting seat, luggage, and detour constraints. Designed to handle high concurrency with low latency using optimized matching algorithms and MongoDB transactions.

---

## 📌 1. System Overview

This system:

* Groups passengers traveling in the same direction into shared cabs
* Respects seat and luggage capacity constraints
* Ensures passenger-specific detour tolerance
* Minimizes total travel deviation
* Handles real-time cancellations safely
* Dynamically calculates fare per passenger
* Designed to scale to **10,000 concurrent users** and **100 RPS**

```

Import it into Postman to test all APIs.

---

## 1️⃣ Create Ride

**POST** `/ride/request`

### 📥 Request

```json
{
  "pickup_lat": 17.2403,
  "pickup_lng": 78.4294,
  "drop_lat": 17.3850,
  "drop_lng": 78.4867,
  "seats_required": 1,
  "luggage_count": 1,
  "detour_tolerance_km": 5,
  "direction": "FROM_AIRPORT"
}
```

### ✅ Success Response

```json
{
  "message": "Ride booked successfully",
  "fare": 120,
  "ride": {
    "_id": "ride_id",
    "ride_group_id": "group_id",
    "status": "CONFIRMED"
  }
}
```

### ❌ Error Example (Seats Exceeded)

```json
{
  "message": "Ride booking failed",
  "error": "Seats requested exceed cab capacity"
}
```

### ❌ Error Example (Luggage Exceeded)

```json
{
  "message": "Ride booking failed",
  "error": "Luggage exceeds cab capacity"
}
```

---

## 2️⃣ Cancel Ride

**POST** `/ride/cancel/:rideRequestId`

### ✅ Success Response

```json
{
  "message": "Ride cancelled successfully"
}
```

### ❌ Error Example

```json
{
  "message": "Ride cannot be cancelled"
}
```

---

## 3️⃣ Get Ride Request

**GET** `/ride/request/:id`

Returns ride details including fare and status.

---

## 4️⃣ Get Ride Group

**GET** `/ride/group/:id`

Returns:

* `cab_id`
* `direction`
* `seats_used`
* `luggage_used`
* `status`

---

## 5️⃣ List Active Groups

**GET** `/ride/groups`

Returns all active forming groups.

---

# 🧠 Matching Algorithm (DSA Approach)

### Steps

1. Fetch candidate groups where:

   ```
   status = FORMING
   direction = requested direction
   ```

2. For each group:

   * Validate seat capacity
   * Validate luggage capacity
   * Simulate route including new passenger
   * Compute additional detour distance
   * Validate passenger detour tolerance

3. Choose group with minimum additional distance.

4. If none valid → create new group.

---

### ⏱ Time Complexity

Let:

* **G** = number of forming ride groups
* **P** = passengers per group (max 4)

Matching complexity:

```
O(G * P log P)
```

Since **P ≤ 4 (constant)**, effectively:

```
O(G)
```

Scales efficiently.

---

### 📦 Space Complexity

```
O(G + P)
```

Minimal in-memory overhead.

---

# 🔒 Concurrency Handling Strategy

### Problem

Multiple users may try to join the same ride group simultaneously.

### Solution

* MongoDB transactions
* Atomic `findOneAndUpdate`
* Capacity constraints enforced inside update query
* Rollback on failure

### Prevents

* Seat overbooking
* Luggage overflow
* Race conditions

---

# 🗄 Database Schema & Indexing

## RideGroup

### Fields

* `cab_id`
* `direction`
* `seats_used`
* `luggage_used`
* `status`

### Index

```js
{ status: 1, direction: 1, seats_used: 1, luggage_used: 1 }
```

Optimizes matching queries.

---

## RideRequest

### Fields

* `pickup_lat`
* `drop_lat`
* `seats_required`
* `luggage_count`
* `detour_tolerance_km`
* `ride_group_id`
* `fare`
* `status`

### Index

```js
{ ride_group_id: 1, status: 1 }
```

Optimizes group passenger lookups.

---

# 💰 Dynamic Pricing Formula

```
baseFare = baseDistance × rate_per_km

sharedFare = baseFare / passengerCount

surgeFactor = 1 + (activeGroups / totalActiveCabs)

detourCost = extraDistance × detour_rate

finalFare =
(sharedFare × surgeFactor) + detourCost
```

Each passenger pays an individual share of total route cost.

# 📊 Scalability Justification

## ✅ 10,000 Concurrent Users

* Stateless APIs allow horizontal scaling
* Multiple Node instances behind load balancer
* MongoDB Atlas cluster support

## ✅ 100 Requests Per Second

* Indexed database queries
* Lightweight O(n) matching
* No external API calls
* Single transaction per request

## ✅ Latency < 300ms

* Indexed filters
* Small constant passenger size (≤4)
* Minimal computation per request
* Efficient DB operations

---

# 📌 Assumptions

* Coordinates are pre-resolved (via geocoding in real-world systems)
* Cab capacity fixed at 4 seats & 4 luggage
* Matching based on drop proximity
* No real-time GPS tracking implemented (design-ready)

---

# 🧪 Example Flow

* Create first ride → New group created
* Create second nearby ride → Joins same group
* Create distant ride → New group created
* Cancel ride → Seats updated atomically
